🚀 MINI PROFESSOR AI
“A 27-Line Python Script That Could Reshape the Way the World Learns Forever.”
🧠 What Is Mini Professor AI?
Let’s cut the fluff.

You didn’t come here for another cute Python script.
You came here because you believe education shouldn’t be locked behind paywalls, privileged degrees, or entrance exams.
You came here because you know that a single question, answered well, can change a life.

Mini Professor AI is your first step in building that future.

It’s a simple, elegant app that lets anyone — from a teen in rural India to a coder in Silicon Valley — type a question about computer science and get a smart, digestible, two-sentence answer… straight from Wikipedia.

No tuition fees.
No textbooks.
No gatekeepers.
Just truth — delivered instantly.

💥 Why It Matters
Let me paint a picture for you.

A 17-year-old student in a small village has dreams of becoming a software engineer. But JEE Physics? Chemistry? Out of reach. College fees? Forget it. But what if — just what if — she had a pocket-sized professor who could answer her every question... right from the command line?

That’s what Mini Professor AI is.

Not just a program.
Not just code.
A seed of a billion-dollar idea: AI that educates the world for free.

You’re not installing a file.
You’re installing hope.

⚙️ How It Works
Behind the scenes, Mini Professor AI harnesses the power of the Wikipedia API — the most universal knowledge base on Earth.

It listens to your question, searches the global hive mind, and returns a clear, simple 2-sentence summary. If it can’t find an answer? It politely lets you know.

And guess what?

You can read the entire logic in under 30 seconds.
Yet what it unlocks is timeless.

🛠️ Installation & Usage
You don’t need a Ph.D. to get this working.

🔹 Step 1: Clone this magic
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mini-professor-ai.git
cd mini-professor-ai

🔹 Step 2: Install the brain
pip install wikipedia

🔹 Step 3: Run the professor
python professor_ai.py
And then?

🧑‍🎓 You ask:

Ask your computer science question: what is a stack in data structure?
🤖 It replies:

Professor AI (from Wikipedia): In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push and pop.
